# grabby
WIP chrome extension that grabs all images that exist on your current tab and allows you to download them.

# To Do
 Remove duplicate srcs from selectedImages array.
 
 Some images are secure and won't display a thumbnail. Find a way to remove those from selectedImages array. Most likely use image.onload()?
 
 Add download functionality. Make sure extension permissions include downloading.
 
 Add select image for download or removal
 
 Style the extension HTML
 
 Find a universal background color that shows the majority of images as thumbnails. As of now, white images are hard to see. Need to find the middle ground
